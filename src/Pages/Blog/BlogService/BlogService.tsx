                        How Does AC Work in a Car?

                      <br />
                      The air-conditioning system in a car works by manipulating
                      refrigerant between a liquid and a gaseous state. As the
                      refrigerant changes states, it absorbs heat and humidity
                      from the vehicle and allows the system to give off cool,
                      dry air.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      To change the refrigerant between a liquid and a gaseous
                      state, the air-conditioning system works to control
                      pressure and temperature.

                      <br />
                      In the past, automotive air condition systems used R-12 as
                      the refrigerant. R-12 (aka Freon) is a very effective
                      CFC-based (chlorofluorocarbon) refrigerant that is not
                      flammable and not poisonous to humans. During the late
                      1980s, scientists discovered that widespread usage of R-12
                      was damaging the earth’s ozone layer

                      biochemical, and psychological tests. Getting the right
                      diagnosis is a crucial aspect of health care or clinical
                      practice as it provides an explanation of a patient's
                      health problem and informs whether a patient has or does
                      not have a condition. Adequate degree of reliability and
                      validity are the most basic parameters that need to be
                      established about any clinical test.
